Hello! I am a Game Programmer with a degree in Computer Engineering.
Over the past three to four years, I have dedicated myself to learning and honing
my game development skills to enhance my abilities and build a robust portfolio.
My goal is to pursue a career as a full-time game developer and create games for everyone to enjoy.
